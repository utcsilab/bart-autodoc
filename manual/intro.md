# Introduction

## Overview

BART is a free and open-source image-reconstruction framework for
Computational Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It consists of a programming
library and a toolbox of command-line programs.

This documentation is meant to be a guide for BART usage and
development. Since this is hand-written rather than machine generated,
some code snippets might be outdated by the time you read them. However,
the general idea should remain the same.

If you have any questions about the implementation details or find
errors in this documentation, please send them to our mailing list
<https://lists.eecs.berkeley.edu/sympa/info/mrirecon>.

The material was presented at the [2016 ISMRM Workshop on Data Sampling
& Image Reconstruction](http://www.ismrm.org/workshops/Data16/) as a
software demo.
