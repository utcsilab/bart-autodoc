# Tools

This section focuses on a few main reconstruction tools in BART and
details their usage and design.

## ecalib

The ecalib tool estimates coil sensitivies using the ESPIRiT calibration
method. It takes a Cartesian kspace data with fully-sampled calibration
region as input and outputs ESPIRiT sensitivity maps with the same image
dimensions as the input kspace. ecalib usage can be as simple as
follows:

    bart ecalib kspace sensitivity

The calibration region does not have to be centered in the kspace array.
ecalib estimates the center of kspace by looking at the maximum kspace
amplitude and extracts the surrounding region as the calibration region.

Non-Cartesian kspace data must first be gridded onto a Cartesian grid
and passed to ecalib. For details about gridding, please see the nufft
section.

## pics

The pics tool performs general parallel imaging and compressed sensing
reconstruction. For Cartesian imaging, it takes kspace data and
sensitivity maps as inputs and outputs an image dataset. By default,
pics performs a SENSE reconstruction using conjugate gradient and can be
used as simple as:

    bart pics kspace sensitivity image

For non-Cartesian imaging, the trajectory file must be supplied with the
flag `-t`. For example:

    bart pics -t trajectory kspace sensitivity image

## nufft

The nufft tool performs non-uniform fast Fourier transform operations.
