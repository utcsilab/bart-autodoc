# Software Implementation

## Memory-mapped Input/Output

Input and output is performed using memory-mapped files. This allows
efficient access to small parts of a large file, e.g. a slice of a 3D
data set.

The use of memory-mapped input/output allows simple processing of
extremely large data sets. While all data can be accessed simply, either
directly with points or using the functions of the library, only the
parts of the data which are actually accessed are loaded into memory.

It is also possible to access data during long-running computations or
debugging stops.

## Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Multi-dimensional arrays are part of almost every framework for image
reconstruction. A set of functions is provided for basic
addressing/indexing, mathematical operations, and some transforms. It
offers simple but powerful interfaces for many operations on
multi-dimensional arrays, e.g. to access slices of an array or to apply
an FFT along selected dimensions.

## GPU Acceleration

Most operations can be transparently accelerated using GPUs. Data can be
allocated on the GPU using:

The generic copy function `md_copy` can be used to copy data from on to
the GPU. Basic operations, FFT, \... are implemented for the CPU and
GPU. The library keeps track of all allocated memory regions and
automatically uses the right function.
